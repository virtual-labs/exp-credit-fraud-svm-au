      "question": "What is the primary goal of SVM when applied to credit card fraud detection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To encrypt transaction data",
        "b": "To classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate",
        "c": "To speed up payment processing",
        "d": "To generate new transaction records"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Encryption is unrelated to SVM.",
        "b": "Correct! SVM is a supervised classifier that separates fraud from genuine transactions.",
        "c": "SVM does not affect processing speed.",
        "d": "Generation of synthetic data is done by other techniques (e.g., SMOTE)."
      },

    {
      "question": "In SVM terminology, the data points that define the position of the maximum-margin hyperplane are called:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Outliers",
        "b": "Slack vectors",
        "c": "Support vectors",
        "d": "Boundary points"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct! Only support vectors influence the final hyperplane and margin."

    {
      "question": "Which kernel is most frequently recommended for real-world credit card fraud detection with SVM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linear",
        "b": "Polynomial",
        "c": "Radial Basis Function (RBF)",
        "d": "Sigmoid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Correct! RBF is the most popular and usually outperforms others due to its flexibility in modeling complex, localized fraud patterns."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is accuracy a misleading metric for evaluating fraud detection models?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because fraud rates are extremely low (severe class imbalance)",
        "b": "Because SVM cannot calculate accuracy",
        "c": "Because accuracy requires balanced classes to be meaningful",
        "d": "Because fraud data has no ground truth"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! With fraud <0.2%, a model predicting 'always legitimate' achieves >99.8% accuracy but detects zero fraud."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main role of the regularization parameter C in soft-margin SVM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To control the shape of the RBF kernel",
        "b": "To balance margin maximization versus training error minimization",
        "c": "To scale the input features",
        "d": "To determine the number of support vectors directly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct! Small C → larger margin (more tolerant to errors); large C → fewer errors (risk of overfitting)."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "In highly imbalanced fraud detection problems, which evaluation metric is generally preferred over ROC-AUC?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Accuracy",
        "b": "Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC)",
        "c": "F1-score of the majority class",
        "d": "Mean Absolute Error"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct! PR-AUC focuses on performance on the rare fraud class and is much more informative than ROC-AUC when positive examples are scarce."
