      "question": "What is the main goal of using Support Vector Machine (SVM) in credit card fraud detection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce the number of credit card transactions",
        "b": "To identify fraudulent transactions accurately",
        "c": "To increase transaction speed",
        "d": "To encrypt transaction data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The goal is not to limit transactions but to detect fraud within them.",
        "b": "Correct! SVM is used to classify and detect fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.",
        "c": "SVM focuses on classification accuracy, not transaction processing speed.",
        "d": "Encryption is a security function, not related to SVM or classification."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a commonly used kernel in SVM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linear kernel",
        "b": "Polynomial kernel",
        "c": "Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel",
        "d": "Sigmoid kernel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Commonly used when data is linearly separable.",
        "b": "Used to model complex, non-linear relationships.",
        "c": "Very popular for non-linear classification tasks.",
        "d": "Correct!Rarely used in practice due to unstable performance in many cases."

    {
      "question": "Why is SVM effective in handling credit card fraud detection problems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It requires no preprocessing",
        "b": "It automatically balances the dataset",
        "c": "It performs well with high-dimensional and imbalanced data",
        "d": "It always gives 100% accuracy"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Preprocessing like normalization is essential for SVM performance.",
        "b": "Class balancing techniques must be applied manually.",
        "c": "Correct!It performs well with high-dimensional and imbalanced data",
        "d": "No model guarantees 100% accuracy in real-world scenarios."

    {
      "question": "What is the role of kernel functions in SVM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To convert numeric data into categorical",
        "b": "To optimize precision and recall",
        "c": "To map data into a higher-dimensional space for better separability",
        "d": "To remove outliers from the data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Data type conversion is unrelated to kernels.",
        "b": "Precision and recall are performance metrics, not roles of kernel functions.",
        "c": "Correct!To map data into a higher-dimensional space for better separability",
        "d": "Kernel functions do not remove outliers; that requires other preprocessing techniques."
